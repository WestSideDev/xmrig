## Usage
**In this example I will use the pool from [Unmineable](https://www.unmineable.com/)**

**Example:**

``./xmrig -o yourpool:port -u Token:Your_wallet_address.name_for_your_miner -p x -k -a rx/0``

``./xmrig -o rx.unmineable.com:3333 -u BTC:bc1q2pu0jpl9f5xv9ltsx8cu0l6h00tghmw63849ms.WestSideDev01 -p x -k -a rx/0``

## Doubts ⁉️
**You can consult the original [repository](https://github.com/xmrig/xmrig) of this project, there you will have more information on how to configure it**

## `⚠️` Warning `⚠️`
**Maybe it's not worth it if your device is average, mining requires a lot of computational power and it's no different on a cell phone, you can get good results using several cell phones and even better if you have a snap 845+**
